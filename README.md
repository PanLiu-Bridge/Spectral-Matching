# Spectral-Matching
An improved time domain spectral matching method with the application of PGA correction, AIF fitting, and PSO algorithm.
The function of BaseLineCorrectionAndFiltering module is to realize baseline correction.
SpectralMatching module mainly sets the spectral matching parameters.
The BasicFunctions module contains the basic functions for spectral matching, including PGA correction, AIF fitting, and PSO algorithm.
